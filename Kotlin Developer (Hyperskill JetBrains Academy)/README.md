# Kotlin Developer — Hyperskill by JetBrains

## 📘 Introduction

This folder contains the **projects and practice problems** from the **Kotlin Developer** Course, offered by JetBrains via the Hyperskill platform.

I'm using this track to build a strong foundation in Kotlin and software development, focusing on real-world projects, problem-solving, and gradual mastery of programming concepts.

Special thanks to JetBrains for providing such a high-quality learning resource.
