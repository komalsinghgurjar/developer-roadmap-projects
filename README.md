# developer-roadmap-projects
🧠 A curated collection of my projects, practice tasks, and certifications from platforms like Hyperskill, CS50x, freeCodeCamp, and LeetCode — tracking my journey as a self-taught developer.

This repository documents my journey to becoming a software engineer through self-taught practical learning.

It includes structured coursework, hands-on projects, and coding challenges from:
- 🎓 CS50x by Harvard (Computer Science fundamentals)
- 🛠 Hyperskill by JetBrains (Kotlin & Android development)
- 🌐 freeCodeCamp (Full-stack web development)
- 💡 LeetCode (Problem-solving & algorithms)

Each folder contains source code, explanations, and insights gained while building the projects or solving problems.

Feel free to explore — all code is solely written by me and is open source to all and free to use.
